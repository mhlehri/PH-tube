              Scope of var, let and const.
            </h1>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">var</h2>
            <p class="text-xl">
              Scope essentially means where these variables are available for
              use. var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally
              scoped. The scope is global when a var variable is declared
              outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared
              with var outside a function block is available for use in the
              whole window. var is function scoped when it is declared within a
              function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only
              within that function.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">let</h2>
            <p class="text-xl">
              A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly
              braces. Anything within curly braces is a block. So a variable
              declared in a block with let is only available for use within that
              block. Let me explain this with an example:
            </p>
            <br />

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">const</h2>
            <p class="text-xl">
              Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const
              declarations share some similarities with let declarations.

              Use cases of null and undefined.
            </h1>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Null</h2>
            <p class="text-xl">
              We have heard the word "null" many times in English. Its literal
              meaning is having no value. The same meaning is analogous to the
              meaning of null in programming. Null is basically an assignment
              value given to a variable. The variable which has been assigned as
              null contains no value.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Undefine</h2>
            <p class="text-xl">
              There is a subtle difference between null and undefined, but as a
              programmer, it is important that we understand it clearly. As the
              name suggests, undefined means "not defined". So we declare a
              variable but do not assign a value to it, the variable becomes
              undefined. Unlike null, the value of an undefined variable is set
              by JavaScript as undefined. The variable gets created at the
              run-time. When we do not pass an argument for a function
              parameter, the default value is taken as undefined. Besides, when
              a function doesn't return a value, it returns undefined.

            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-3">Rest API</h1>
            <p class="text-xl">
              An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules
              that define how applications or devices can connect to and
              communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to
              the design principles of the REST, or representational state
              transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are
              sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-xl">
              First defined in 2000 by computer scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in
              his doctoral dissertation, REST provides a relatively high level
              of flexibility and freedom for developers. This flexibility is
              just one reason why REST APIs have emerged as a common method for
              connecting components and applications in a microservices
              architecture.
